# metahotkey

MetaHotKey is a script that makes scripts and assigns them to key combinations using the AutoHotKey_L language. (https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L)

MetaHotKey was the program that started me on this path. It is here for posterity as much as a reminder of where I came from.

It was written in barebones notepad. No safety net. Lots of saving and reloading as I learned the AutoHotKey language.

MetaHotKey was born in my job as an email first tech support role. In every interaction there were things that we had to add to every customer interaction that were not automated for me. So I used AutoHotKey to bridge the gap. Soon, everybody wanted to use the script I had written for myself. Many co-workers were resorting to a wordpad file to copy and paste from.

Instead of people struggling to learn the AutoHotKey language themselves or having to hack my script to their personal needs, I decided to make a self editing script that would allow people to make their own scripts at will without having to navigate the language.

Since the implementation on display here is a bit of a mess, one of my projects is to code MetaHotKey 2.0 using all the things I have learned since to make a cleaner, smoother, more deadly app.
